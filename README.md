Conclusion
This project was a great way to practice my  JavaScript, CSS and HTML skills. It was challenging to implement the logic for the game, but it was rewarding to see the game come to life in the browser. Overall, I am very happy with the final product and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it.
